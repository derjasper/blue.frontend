Cookbook
========

Now we'll show you what you can do with this API and give you some tips and tricks
how to use blue.frontend.

The cookbook is very small and will be filled with more content in following releases.

The following topics will be covered in future, but I was too lazy to write them
(documenting isn't fun...):

- Navigations using scrollposition and sticky mixins
- Popovers, Dialogs und Dropdowns using variables and trigger
- More complex menu structures using the list module
- Image positioning and aligning using container
- Integrating blue.frontend with AngularJS

Until these golden times, please have a look at the demo pages and the SASS
source code.
