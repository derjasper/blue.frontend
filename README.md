blue.frontend - a frontend framework
====================================

Features
--------

A SASS & JavaScript library to write a website's frontend. You can define JavaScript functionality using SASS mixins.

Learn more about the framework itself: [Docs](http://derjasper.github.io/blue.frontend/docs), [Demo](http://derjasper.github.io/blue.frontend/demo) & [Website](http://derjasper.github.io/blue.frontend/).

Notes
-----

When I started the development of the framework two years ago to make things easier, a lot of things were different in web development.


The framework is very useful for websites renderer server-side (works with Drupal, Bolt.cm, ...). It requires minimal effort to add extended design functionalities to websites.

Although it works with Angular 1.x, this is not be recommeded due to performance and design reasons (AngularJS can do things blue.frontend can do) ; I expect that it will be incompatible with Angular 2.


The SASS part of the framework uses good old CSS properties. If compatibility is not a problem, use flexbox. (For this reason, I plan to make a plain SCSS framework.)


The JavaScript part is the more interesting part and should be seen as proof-of-concept. I managed it to define my own CSS properties and implement them in JavaScript (seamless & fully responsive). I'm not a professional JS developer, so there may be better ways to do the job. I would be glad to receive feedback about the idea and about how the framework could be improved to find its place in modern web development (if there is any).

There is an old roadmap in ROADMAP.md
