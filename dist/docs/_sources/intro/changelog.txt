Changelog and Versioning
========================

Version numbers
---------------

Version numbers follow this scheme:

``<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>-<bugfix>``

- A major release contains big changes in the framework's structure and delivers
breaking changes.
- A minor release introduces new features, (minor) API changes are possible.
- A maintenance release may deliver new features, bugfixes, performance improvements,
but it won't break your code, but minor regressions may occur in rare cases.
- A bugfix release contains bugfixes only, no API changes are made at all.
