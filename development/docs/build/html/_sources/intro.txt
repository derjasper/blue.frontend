Intro
=====

*blue leaf* is a SASS and JavaScript/jQuery library to design websites. It
provides basic mixins to define the website's layout and behaviour. All features
are responsive and respond instantly to new screen sizes. Also, blue leaf does
not want to preset any styles when it comes to colors, margins, typography and 
so on. If you feel that there is something not as universal as it could be, 
please create an issue.

One striking feature is that **SASS mixins can define behaviour that is not
possible with CSS**, such as sticky elements or trigger. The blue leaf's core
script parses JavaScript comments for JSON data and applys the features on the
given selectors. See :doc:`api/sassmodules/customrules` for more information.
