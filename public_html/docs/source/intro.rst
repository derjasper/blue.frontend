Intro
=====

*blue leaf* is a SASS and JavaScript/jQuery library to design websites. It
provides basic mixins to define the website's layout and behaviour. All features
are responsive and respond instantly to new screen sizes.

One striking feature is, that the **SASS mixins can define behaviour that is not
possible with CSS**, such as sticking elements or trigger. The blue leaf's core
script parses JavaScript comments for JSON data and applys the features on the
given selectors. See :doc:`api/customrules` for more information.
